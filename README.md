# Chao Over Koco Mod for Sonic Frontiers
This mod replaces the base Koco models and voices with Chao. For now, it's only these specific Kocos. I've even gotten the Chao to partially animate, such as the ball floating above their heads &amp; their feet! You'll get to hear their little sounds from the Adventure games as well.<br><br><h2 class="SelectedElement"><i>I plan to add a number of different additions to expand upon the mod, so please read the TODO's on GameBanana before commenting or messaging me with a suggestion.</i></h2><br><br><br>
